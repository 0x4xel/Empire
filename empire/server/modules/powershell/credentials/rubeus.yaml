  Rubeus is a C# toolset for raw Kerberos interaction and abuses.
  It is heavily adapted from Benjamin Delpy's Kekeo project (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license)
  and Vincent LE TOUX's MakeMeEnterpriseAdmin project (GPL v3.0 license). Full credit goes
  to Benjamin and Vincent for working out the hard components of weaponization- without
  their prior work this project would not exist.
